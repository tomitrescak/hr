# Add Person Functionality Test

## Features Implemented:

1. **Backend API Endpoint** (`lib/trpc/routers/people.ts`)
   - Added `create` procedure that requires PM role
   - Uses `pmProcedure` to restrict access to PROJECT_MANAGER role only
   - Validates input (name, email, password, role, entryDate)
   - Hashes password with bcrypt
   - Creates both User and Person records in transaction
   - Logs the creation in ChangeLog
   - Prevents duplicate emails

2. **UI Component** (`components/people/add-person-dialog.tsx`)
   - Dialog form with all necessary fields
   - Only shows to users with PROJECT_MANAGER role
   - Form validation and error handling
   - Automatically refreshes people list after successful creation

3. **People Page Integration** (`app/people/page.tsx`)
   - Added "Add Person" button in page header
   - Only visible to PROJECT_MANAGER role users
   - Consistent with existing UI patterns

## Security Features:
- ✅ Role-based access control (only managers can add people)
- ✅ Input validation (email format, password length, name length)
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (salt rounds: 12)
- ✅ Email uniqueness validation
- ✅ Transaction-based data creation (ensures consistency)
- ✅ Audit logging (ChangeLog entry created)

## How to Test:
1. Log in as a user with PROJECT_MANAGER role
2. Navigate to `/people` page
3. Click "Add Person" button
4. Fill out the form and submit
5. Verify new person appears in the list
6. Try logging in as the new user to confirm account creation

## UI/UX Features:
- Form validation with required fields
- Loading state during submission
- Error message display
- Form reset after successful submission
- Auto-close dialog after success
- Accessible form labels and inputs

The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns and maintains security by restricting access to managers only.
